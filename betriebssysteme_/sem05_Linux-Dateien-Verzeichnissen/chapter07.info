Create an empty file named exercise.txt and move this file to the /tmp directory, using a relative pathname from your home directory. Then, delete this file using an absolute pathname.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

            Use the command line to perform operations in Linux.
            Search for files.
            Create and manage files.
            Install and update software.



You have completed Chapter 7. Letâ€™s summarize the key concepts we covered:

* Virtual terminals (VT) in Linux are consoles, or command line terminals that use the connected monitor and keyboard.
* Different Linux distributions start and stop the graphical desktop in different ways.
* A terminal emulator program on the graphical desktop works by emulating a terminal within a window on the desktop.
* The Linux system allows you to either log in via text terminal or remotely via the console.
* When typing your password, nothing is printed to the terminal, not even a generic symbol to indicate that you typed.
* The preferred method to shut down or reboot the system is to use the shutdown command.
* There are two types of pathnames: absolute and relative.
* An absolute pathname begins with the root directory and follows the tree, branch by branch, until it reaches the desired directory or file.
* A relative pathname starts from the present working directory.
* Using hard and soft (symbolic) links is extremely useful in Linux.
* cd remembers where you were last, and lets you get back there with cd -.
* locate performs a database search to find all file names that match a given pattern.
* find locates files recursively from a given directory or set of directories.
* find is able to run commands on the files that it lists, when used with the -exec option.
* touch is used to set the access, change, and edit times of files, as well as to create empty files.
* The Advanced Packaging Tool (apt) package management system is used to manage installed software on Debian-based systems.
* You can use the Yellowdog Updater Modified (yum) open source command-line package management utility for RPM-compatible Linux operating systems.
* The zypper package management system is based on RPM and used for openSUSE.
