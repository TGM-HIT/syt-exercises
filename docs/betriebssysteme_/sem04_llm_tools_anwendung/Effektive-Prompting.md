# Effective Prompting

For generalized prompting we can use a simple seven-step framework that is serviceable in most educational settings that entails assigning the LLM with a Role, Task, Context, Exemplar, Focus, Format and Tone.

1. Role assignment
   Assign a role to the LLM to fulfill the task you have in mind. This can range from an expert in a discipline to a specific individual. For instance you can input either “You will be acting as a professional physicist” or “You will be acting as Einstein.” It is recommended to immediately provide any adjustments to that personality, e.g. “You will be acting as a meticulous, detail-oriented, and supportive English professor for students between the ages of 12 and 18.”
2. Task
   Clearly articulate the specific task or objective you want to achieve. This should be direct and unambiguous, leaving no room for interpretation about the desired outcome. For instance, instead of saying e.g. "Please help with writing," specify "Please write a 500-word newspaper article appropriate for CEFR B2 language learners on architecture."
3. Context
   Provide background information or the broader setting of your request. This includes the purpose behind the task (e.g., educational, professional), the intended audience (e.g., experts, general public), and any constraints (e.g., deadline, word limit). Context helps tailor the response more precisely to your needs,e.g. "Please write a 500-word newspaper article on architecture for use in creating a reading comprehension exercise for third year students at an Austrian Allgemeinbildende Höhere Schule/Academic Secondary School."
4. Exemplar
   Offering an example or model can guide the desired output's structure, content, or tone. This could be a link to a similar work, a brief outline, key points to cover, or an actual example pasted into the prompt. Exemplars serve as a concrete benchmark for the expected result.
5. Specific focus
   This involves specifying any personal preferences, needs, or interests that could influence the response. For instance, if you have a preference for certain methodologies, terminologies, or conceptual frameworks, stating these can lead to more personalized and relevant responses.
6. Format
   Define the structural requirements of the output, including length (word count, number of pages), terminology (simple, technical), language (formal, informal), style (APA, MLA), and text type (article, essay, report, narrative). Clear format guidelines ensure that the output meets specific presentation or publication standards.
7. Tone
   The tone involves the emotional quality or attitude conveyed in the response. It could range from professional, enthusiastic, skeptical, to humorous. Defining the tone is particularly important when the output is meant for communication or educational purposes, as it sets the mood and influences the reader's engagement.
